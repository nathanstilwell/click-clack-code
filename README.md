# Click, Clack, Code: Mechanical Keyboards & You

> This talk is an intro to mechanical keyboards for people who type for a living. I will introduce the vocabulary around mechanical keyboards (and keyboards in general), the options available to the professional typist, and the considerations in choosing your typing technology.

This is the talk I proposed to give at [Brooklyn.js](https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/217). If all goes well, I will give this talk on December 17th at [Brooklyn.js 0.3.2](https://ti.to/BrooklynJS/brooklynjs-0-3-2).
