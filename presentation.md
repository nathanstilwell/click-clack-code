# [fit] I :heart: my keyboard

^ Hi everybody. Tonight I'd like to talk about my keyboard

---

![](images/kinesis-advantage.jpg)
# This is our story

^ and tell you our story. :)

---

# been typing for
# [fit] 20 years

^ - When I started at Gilt in 2011 ...

^ - typing for about 20 years

---

# at age 33, my wrist started hurting

^ about a year later my wrist started hurting

---

# [fit] Hazards of the trade
### Repetitive Strain Injury
### vs
### Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

^ - If, like me, you type for a living

^ - our trade isn't without hazards.

^ - common career-ending injuries amoungst programmers are RSI and Carpal Tunnel

---

# RSI
### you do something over and over until it hurts

^ - You get RSI from performing a single action repeatedly. Like pushing buttons.

^ - The best defense is taking breaks, stretching and excercise. 

^ - PSA to Emacs users, in preparing for this talk I found a strong correlation between Emacs and RSI (google it Bryan)

# Carpal Tunnel

^ Carpel Tunnel happens because of strain to the tendons in your wrists.

# [fit] Not a doctor

^ Just a note, I'm not a doctor. So while it's good to be aware of these things, if you're in pain, please seek medical attention

# So I tried a kinesis

^ Being at Gilt

^ immersed in Kinesis culture

^ gave it a try

---

# it looks like this

![fit](images/my-kinesis.jpg)

^ which looks intimidating, and I won't lie, there is an adjustment period

---

![](images/struggle.gif)
# The struggle was real

^ - Between the concave key "pits", the distance of the split, and the thumb keys it took some getting used to.

^ - 3 days to get back to 80%, 3 months to get to 100%

---

# Instant Advantages

* Key remapping
* Thumb Keys
* Satisfying click
* My wrist stopped hurting

^ but once I got over the initial shock there were some "kinesis advantages". 

--- 

# Key remapping

![inline fit](images/key-remapping.png)

^ - The Kinesis has the ability to change layout or remap individual keys

^ - being a vim user, I made some adjustments up front that 
I've stuck with for the past 3 years.

^ - Caps Lock -> Ctrl, Del -> ESC, and I switched the arrows -> j and k

---

# Thumb Keys

![inline](images/thumb-keys-left.jpg)![inline](images/thumb-keys-right.jpg)

^ - perhaps the biggest adjustment

^ - quickly appearant how under-utilized my thumbs had been

^ - Keyboard shortcuts got a lot more comfortable

---

![](images/heee.gif)
# I was hooked

^ - Once the Kinesis started to feel "natural" I was hooked.

^ - Typing was comfortable and actually more fun.

---

### The Kinesis is a 
# "mechanical keyboard"
 
^ - Once we became besties, I wanted to learn more about my new friend.
^ - The kinesis is a mechanical keyboard. That means there is a separate complete switches underneath every key.

---

# Cherry

Cherry MX. They are made in Germany.

![inline fill](images/cherry-brown.gif)![inline fill](images/cherry-red.gif)![inline fill](images/cherry-blue.gif)

^ The most popular switch manufactuer is Cherry from Germany. Their most popular product is the Cherry MX key switch
 
---

## I started with tactile switches

![left](images/cherry-brown.gif)

Give you a tactile bump on activation

^ My first Kinesis had Cherry browns. They give you a little "bump" when the key is activated

---

## Then I switched to linear switches

![left](images/cherry-red.gif)

Cherry Linear switches have a consistent force through out the key press.

^ - After some experimentation I landed on the linear cherry reds

^ - They take less force to activate, but don't give any feedback.

^ - somewhat controversial amongst enthusiests since the "bump" keeps you from bottoming out

---

## Clicky switches

![left](images/cherry-blue.gif)

These tend to be some of the loudest of the Cherry switches.

^ - Which is why Cherry introduced their "clicky" switches

^ - more "bump" 

^ - louder, so everyone can tell how productive you are
